**Mindset** can be defined as the beliefs of someone that make him or her act in a specific manner in their lives. The growth of the mindset is contorled by the development and the perseverance that the person do in order to handle the obstacles and the challanges they face in their way to acheive what are they looking forward. 

In order to keep my **Mindset** growing I tend to rememorize myself:
* Nothing lasts forever.
* You had been in worst conditions and you eventually survived.
* Keep looking, searching and reading and always **surround** yourself with people who encourage you to keep up all the time.
