# What is CSS?

*Cascading Style Sheets* (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With **CSS**, you can control the *color*, *font*, the *size of text*, the *spacing between elements*, how *elements are* ***positioned*** and laid out, what background images or **background** colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

## Tip
 The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

 CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

 >  h1 {
  
 > color: red;

  >  font-size: 5em;
> 
}

## CSS Modules
As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).

At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification. 

For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.

That's all for todat. You can visit my [webpage](https://bayan-hmaidy98.github.io/reading-notes/), so you can find more of my readings.
