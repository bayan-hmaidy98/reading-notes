# Introduction to Node.js

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. **Note** that *Node.js* is not a framework nor a language but a run time open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. 

### In your own words, what is V8 JavaScript engine?

It is an open-source JS engine used to compile JS to native machine code that the computer can handle and excute. 

### What is npm?

A package manger for JS that is bundled with Node. It 's also the world's largest softwere registry. 

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime? 

`Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.`

### What version of node are you running on your machine?
`v14.17.4`

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
`6.14.14`

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
`npm install -g jshint` (-g means it will install it globally).

### What is node used for?
It is designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency: it would be easuer to catch mistakes while two heads are working in the code. 

2. Engaged collaboration: it engeges more experience while writing the same code. Also it makes errors faster to be revealed.

3. Learning from fellow students: both of the driver and navigator would have different techniques in problem solving. Even if there is one that is more experienced than the other, they would `each a student who is less familiar with that area.`

4. Social skills: in order to code in an effiecient way, communication is the key! 

5. Job interwiew readiness: it's common now to involove pair programming in interviews to see how the applicant will fit into the team. 

6. work environment readiness. 

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? 
Learning from fellow students. I have learned a lot from my colleague when we worked as a pair. 

### How does pair programming work?
It has two roles: the driver and the navigator. The driver is the person who code and the navigator is the person who guide the driver in coding.
