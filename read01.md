# How to structure a website?

The strucure of any website aims to make it readable to the targeted ausiance. So, headings and subheadings are used in any document to reflect a hierarchy of information. HTML is used for that, **structuring the website!**

`Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.` Tags are usedin HTML to tell the browser something.

# Code in a Content Management System

Sometimes in editing the page, you will need only to edit parts of it than the entire page, for example: content management system, blogging platform, or e-commerce 
application. So, what is done un this case, `using a single 
'template' to control all of the pages for a section of the site. If you imagine an e-commerce store with 1,000 items for sale, just altering one template is a lot easier than changing the page for each individual product. Some content management systems offer tools that also 
allow you to edit the template files. `

**Note:** To learn more about HTML and discover it's techniques, you can look in the source code of the website by simply clicking the right click on wesite interface and choose view page source.

To add a comment in HTML `<-- comment goes here -->. **Don't worry,** your comment will not visible to the user, only for who digs through the source code. 

## Block Elements and inline elements
Text that appears in new line uses block level elements, like: `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.`

Text that have attributes in it and all gothered in the same line uses inline elements. Examples of inline elements are 
`<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>`

## `<div tag>`
The `<div>` tag allows you to sort the structure of the website and make the code more readable. For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the 
navigation), or you might create a <div> element to contain 
comments from visitors.

## `<span>`
The span tag works like `<div>` tag, and we can use it if:
1. We want to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
2. We want to control the appearance of the content of 
these elements using CSS.

## `<iframe>`
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your 
page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame. The most famous example for `<iframe>` tag is GoogleMaps.

## `<meta> tag`
Inside the `<head>` tag, any used tag does not affect the appeance of the page and it is not visible to the users. It is created to tell information about the page. One of the used tags in `<head>` is `<meta>.` The `<meta>` element is an empty element carries an attribute inside it and don't have a closing tag.

The `<nav>` element is used to contain the major avigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation. Note that `<nav>` tag is **non-semantic** tag. 

## `<section> tag` 

The `<section>` element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. Because the `<section>` element groups related items together, it may contain several distinct `<article>` elements that have a common theme or purpose.
