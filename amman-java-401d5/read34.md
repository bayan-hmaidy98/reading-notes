# Choose a monetization model for your app 


Use Google Play's billing system to sell digital goods or services within an app on Google Play. Google Play's billing system makes it easy for users to consistently, securely, and seamlessly purchase your goods and services for your app. Once users save a payment method on Google Play, they can use that same payment method for all future purchases on Google Play with just a tap.

Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

* Virtual game products, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or avatars, additional levels or playtime.
* App functionality or content, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version.
* Subscription services, such as streaming media, digital publications, and social networking services.
* Cloud software products, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software.
