## OO Design

### Rules to follow in programming

DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY)

is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization.

Repetition in code is a waste in **time, performance and space**; that's why we need to keep it as simple as possible.

The principle was formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas who applied it to include databases schemas, test plans, documentation and more.

When applied successfully, modification of any element within the system shouldn't require any modifications for logically unrelated elements.

### Why do we need an MVP in software development ?

Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources.

Accelerate learning.

Reduce wasted engineering hours.

Get the product to early customers as soon as possible.

Base for other products.

### Minimum Viable Product

Minimum Viable Product or MVP is a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get the attention of the consumers. The final product is released in the market only after getting sufficient feedback from the product's initial users.
