## Inheritance and Interfaces

### Objects 

Objects in programming are created to **simulate** *real-world objects*. This is done by realising what makes real-world object a real-worl object! In other words, all real- world objects share 2 charecteristics that make them ditinguished from any other objects, **state** & **behaviour**. Objects in programming share another property with real objects, they have objects inside other objects. 

### Classes 

Classes can be defined as `the blueprint from which individual objects are created.` In this way, we can have many instances to create using **class** of **objects.** 

### Interfaces

They are similar to classes, I mean they can contain constants or methods. But the main difference is they **can't** be instaniated like classes. They are either extend classes or extend other interface. `When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.`

**Note:** interfaces are refernce data type. 

### Inheritance 

Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. Except for the Object class, a class has exactly one direct superclass. A class inherits fields and methods from all its superclasses, whether direct or indirect. A subclass can override methods that it inherits, or it can hide fields or methods that it inherits. (Note that hiding fields is generally bad programming practice.)
