# Images 

## Contolling the size of images
By determinin the size of images (height and width), pages will load smoothly because the HTML and CSS often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

## Controlling the apperance of the image
1. Align the image to the left or right using float property.
2. Centering the images using margin property. 
3. Background image (the whole page or part of it).
4. Repeating images (repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat, fixed, scroll)
5. Background position to specify its place in the page (left top, left center, left bottom, center top, center center, right top, right center, right bottom)
6. Image rollovers and sprites: change button background when hovering and cliching on it. 
6. Background gradient: you need to specify 2 colors to create linear gradient, for example.

# Search engine optimization

## What does SEO mean?

Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

### Areas of SEO
1. Nn-page techniques: On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.
2. Off-page techniques: Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.

In order to improve the findability of the website, the following keyword must be taken care of:
1. Page title
2. Web adress
3. Headings
4. Texts
5. Link text
6. Image alt text
