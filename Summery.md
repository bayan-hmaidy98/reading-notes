Today we went across a new course in our learning path. We have started learning about GitHup and creating accounts to be able to use Markdown language. We have used differnt themes and proparities to foramt the texts, such as the font-size, **bold** and *italic* texts and inserting pictures, links and tables.

Also our instructor asked us to write a small review of in article he provided us with using the Githup and here is mine. [Mindset](https://bayan-hmaidy98.github.io/reading-notes/Mindset)
