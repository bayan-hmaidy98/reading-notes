The domain model is a conceptual model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data. A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams. 

# Tables 
A table represents information in a grid format. Collecting data and insert them into tables will make it easier to read. The table cell is each block of the grid in the table. 

## How to insert a table in `HTML? 
`<table>`  element is used to create a table. `<tr>` indicates the start of each row using the opening `<tr>` tag.  And each cell of a table is represented using a `<td>`. `<th>` to represent heading for either a column or a row. In order to stretch across more than one column, or more than one row, we use `colspan`  and `rowspan` attributes respectively. 

## How to differentiate between the main content of the table and the content (first column and last column would have different content)?

* `<thead>` The headings of the table should sit inside the `<thead>` element. 
* `<tbody>` The body should sit inside the `<tbody>` element. 
* `<tfoot>` The footer belongs inside the `<tfoot>` element.
