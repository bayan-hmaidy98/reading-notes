# Building Websites from the scratch

When you are about to build a *website*, you must pay attention to some points before getting start coding. 

Wireframing is one of the **first** steps you need to pay attention for, and it means to make a drawing of the design of the website, without  any fancy colors, you just show the navigation bar place, headlines, paragraphs, images, etc... It's important to consider the `user interaction` with the website while designing the wireframe. you can design your fireframe using a software or even draw it manually. 

In order to make the wireframe you need to do the following:

1. Do your research and get closer to the ***audience*** needs, so your design would fit.
2. Keep your refrences and research close to you and make them clear because you will defintally need them in the future!
3. Map your wireframe incase of editing or even walking throw the design.
4. Remember that wireframe is only about the structure not the details, so you'll have drafts not real drawings
5. If all the above worked well, don't hesitate to put details that would benefit you while designing. 
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

# What is the next step?
After making a proper design of the wireframe, you're ready to the next step! Using **HTML**, you can start designing the structure of the wireframe. It is actually a markup language that include *tags* and elements inside it to make the required properities in the website. 

### Let's get closer to tags, attributtes and elements meaning and jobs.

Tags are parts of an element. For example, the picture specify that we have 2 tags: opening and closing tags and between them, there is a content which  we apply the tag properties on. We also have empty tags that don't have a content or ending tag (for example: <br> that is used as line break).

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content and it is included in the tag as shown in the image below. 

![Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png)

You can also nest elements togather like the following example.

>  <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>


In order to insert an image you use img tag as illustrated bellow:

> <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

Here we can see how to add links to the website.
> <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>


### Heading are defined by<h#> tag and # could be (1-6).
**<h1>** is the most important and **<h6>** is the least important.

 HTML can not stand alone to build a website, so there is other languages used. CSS describes a web page's appearance/presentation Also, we have JavaScript is responsible for the functionality and the behaviour of the elements.
