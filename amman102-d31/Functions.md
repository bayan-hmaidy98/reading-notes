# JavaScript Functions
BLock of **code** designed in (particular) to perform a task, and it's only excuted when it is invoked.

## Syntax 
![JavaScript Syntax](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1587882057-1.png)
**Notes**: 

1. Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

2. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as
local variables.

## Why Functions?
1. **Reusable**: Define the function only once and apply it through calling as much as it's needed.
2. **Feasable**: Functions could be used multible times and gain differnet results.
3. **Arrangement**: Functions are used for organizing the the code and split it into smaller parts.

## Function Return

Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
While excuting the function, it will stop by reaching the **return statement**, and when the function is called or invoked by a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

## Local Variables
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. 
Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
