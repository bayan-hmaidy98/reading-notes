## Markdown

 

Markdown seems to be a format method for texts cloudly and its extension is **.md**. I think it's similar to what we have learned in CSS but in a different writing way. It's used in [*GitHub*](https://github.com/). As Bashar (our instructor) told us today: `It's more prefarable to use html and CSS languages in creating web pages because of the unlimiteed options we have got there, in addition GitHup is easy and simple for people who are looking to create their own blogs.`


I'm not sure if I have quoted perfectly, it is based on my golden fish memory. üê†

 

'till we meet again, Meow night everyone.
